# AboutMe

I'm Steve Stark. I'm originally from the NYC area, but I've lived in FL for a long time. I have a BA in English from UC Berkeley. I've been a real estate agent for 6 years, and I am a founding partner of the Aspire Group at Engel & VÃ¶lkers Melbourne Beachside in Brevard County, FL. Prior to my real estate career, I was an English as a Second Language (ESL) instructor and Academic Coordinator in NYC, Philly, Miami and Melbourne, FL. I feel I've lived many other lifetimes within this one life, as well, and my entry into the realm of FinTech represents the start of yet another. 
My career goal is to either work for Cardano/IOHK or to program on the Cardano blockchain from the outside. I feel the timing couldn't be more perfect for this, since the opportunities are about to explode.test
